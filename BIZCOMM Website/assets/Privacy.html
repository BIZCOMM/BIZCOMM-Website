            <p class="text-left">You might also need to provide personal information about other individuals to us (e.g. about your authorised representative). If so, we rely on you to have informed those individuals that you are giving their personal information

            <p class="text-left"><strong>How to we collect your information?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-left">There are three ways that we can collect your information.</p>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li class="text-left"><strong>You give it to us</strong> when you or your representative interacts with either us or one of our trusted partners. This might happen when you are setting up an account with us or using one of our products or services.</li>
                <li class="text-left"><strong>We collect information</strong> when you use our networks, products and services including our call centres and online services. For example, we may use network tools to collect your call records, collect wireless device
                    locations from our networks and your devices or use cookies and other technologies to identify your unique web browser.</li>
                <li class="text-left"><strong>We obtain information from outside sources</strong> like credit reports, marketing mailing lists, and public information, (including public posts to social networking sites) and commercially available personal, identity,
                    geographic and demographic information. This can also include information gained from our partners if you have interacted with them. These partners include our business and commercial partners, identity and fraud checking
                    services, credit reporting bodies and wholesale and other customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-left">We understand that you might not want to give us particular personal information. If so, that may mean we are not able to provide you with the products or services you need.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>How do we keep your information?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-left">We may store your information in hard copy or electronic format and keep it in storage facilities that we own and operate ourselves, or that are owned and operated by our service providers.</p>
            <p class="text-left">We use a combination of technical solutions, security controls and internal processes to help us protect your information and our network from unauthorised access and disclosure.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">We endeavour to ensure that personal information is kept as current as possible and that irrelevant or excessive data is deleted or made anonymous as soon as reasonably practicable. However, some personal information may be retained
                for varying time periods in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for other legitimate business reasons.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>How do we use your information?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-left">We will only use your information if we have a lawful reason to do so such as when it&rsquo;s our legal duty or we have your consent and when it&rsquo;s in our legitimate interest to do so. These include:</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Administration -</strong> To help us properly manage the products and services we provide to you and to maintain and update our records. For example, we need to be able to verify your identity to detect, prevent and address
                fraud. We also use your information for charging and billing and to identify breaches of our terms and conditions of service.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Network, security and fraud protection -</strong> As part of our network protection activities, we monitor Domain Name Servers (DNS) for known malicious domains which can, amongst other things, lead to the downloading of
                malicious software on to devices. Where Telstra&rsquo;s DNS services are used to connect to these known malicious domains, we may identify impacted customers for the purposes of notifying them so they can take action to protect
                themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Communication -</strong> We need to be able to communicate with you in order to provide you with our products and services. We might do this on mediums such as email, SMS, social media, search engines and web pages you
                may visit.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Improvement &ndash;</strong> We are constantly working to not only maintain and improve our products, services and processes but to develop new ones. We use information we hold to help us do this in several ways. For example,
                to monitor network use, quality and performance, and to operate, maintain, develop, test and upgrade our systems and infrastructure. We may also combine information from one service with information from one of our partners&rsquo;
                services to improve our credit assessment and debt recovery processes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Development and analysis -</strong> It&rsquo;s important we understand your information and communication needs. One of the ways we do this is through using analysis and business intelligence techniques. This gives us high
                level insights into things like usage patterns, network performance, demographic trends and other types of behavioural data. In many cases this information is aggregated and de-identified when analysed. We may share these anonymised
                insights with select business and commercial partners. In some cases, we may create insights with your information on an identified basis but would only do so in compliance with privacy laws (such as, with your consent).</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Direct marketing -</strong> We want to make sure that you know about all our products, services and special offers that are relevant and are of interest to you. We may use the information we hold to market and promote them
                directly to you. This also may include products, services and offers provided by our trusted partners. In some cases, this marketing activity can continue after you have stopped using our products or services, unless you opt-out.
                You can stop us using your information for direct marketing by updating your preferences by contacting us directly.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><strong>Compliance -</strong> There are several circumstances where we are required or authorised by law to collect, use or disclose information. These include:</p>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li class="text-left">as required or authorised by legislation (for example under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) including the data retention provisions)</li>
