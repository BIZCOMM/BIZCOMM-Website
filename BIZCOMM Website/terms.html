                        <span class="termsBold" style="font-weight: bold;">Term and effect</span> Quotes will only be valid for 30 days unless otherwise specified in the Quote, or otherwise advised in writing. A Quote is merely an invitation to You to
                        place an Order with Us and the acceptance of a Quote by You will not create a binding contract between You and Us.<br><br>b. The Quote is valid for period specified on the Quote/proposal. Expiry dates on Quotes are set to be able
                        to inform Us when the quote is still active or to be discarded. Once discarded the Quote will need to be requested again.<br><br>c. Once a Quote has been confirmed by Us, then the prices in the Quote will be confirmed as the final
                        agreed price. A Quote is confirmed as &lsquo;final&rsquo; as soon as both parties agree with the final price after any last changes requested by You.<br><br>d. The price in the final Quote may vary from the original request if
                        there is any price or product changes requested by You. During the validity period of the Quotation, vendor pricing may be subject to change based on product pricing adjustments or exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations
                        lie outside of our control; therefore, we reserve the right to update the product pricing accordingly.
                        <br><br>e. Considerable care has been taken in the preparation of this quotation; however, inaccuracies may occur, and we cannot therefore accept responsibility for any errors, omissions or changes during the validity of this quote.
                        Should any errors or omissions be identified, we will update the Quote accordingly and provide You with the revised Quote.
                        <br><br>f. Quotes and estimates shall be deemed to correctly interpret the original specifications and are based on the cost at the time the Quote or estimate is given. If You later require any changes to the Quotes, and We agree
                        to the changes, these changes will be charged at Our prevailing rate.<br><br>g. Once the Quote has been confirmed and converted to an Order, the Order will be subjected to our normal Terms and Condition of Sale.<br><br>h. The general
                        minimum turnaround time for Quote request to be actioned is usually 24 hours. If a Quote is required urgently, please let us know so that we can respond to it accordingly.
                        <br><br>i. When a special price or discount offer has been applied to this Quote, no other special promotion, discount or bonus offer will be applicable.<br><br>j. If products in the Quote are subjected to any price and supply
                        fluctuations that is outside of Our control, we reserve the right to update the price and product in the Quote accordingly before or after Quote approval. If a product has undergone a price drop or a price increase, the Quote will
                        then be adjusted accordingly. If there is a product that is no longer available, the product will then be replaced or substituted based on Your request and is subject to Your final approval.
                        <br><br>k. Price on non-stocked products are subjected to Price and stock fluctuations and can only be confirmed once the Quote is turned into an Order. While We endeavour to honour every price quoted, if there is a price increase
                        that is beyond our control, we reserve the right to increase the price as necessary.<br><br>l. Once a Quote has already passed the expired date, we may cancel the Quote or estimate without having to notify or receive an approval
                        from You.
                        <br><br>m. ETA information is based on an estimate given by our vendors and cannot be held as the actual promised date.<br><br>n. Freight on the quoted product is subject to price fluctuations and can only be confirmed once the
                        Quote has been converted to an Order. While we endeavour to honour every price quoted, if there is a price increase that is beyond our control, we reserve the right to increase the price as we deem necessary.<br><br>o. We do not
                        keep inventory, and as such only order items once we receive a completed Order from You. If You would like to return an item or cancel an Order, a restocking fee may apply. We will need to get approval from the distributor that
                        the stock is returnable before being able to issue a refund as not all products can be returned.
                        <br><br>p. Prices are quoted on the basis that all Quoted items are purchased.
                        <br><br>q. Unless specified, all items on the Quote are covered by manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty covering parts and labour for hardware only on a return to depot basis.

                            Quotes</span> We may vary or withdraw a Quote at any time in Our absolute discretion and without prior notice to You. We may do so for any reason We consider fit, including, where the Goods or Services become unavailable or

                            appearance of validity</span> In the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary, we may rely upon the apparent validity of an Order. If any Order is signed or sent by email or approved through the web-based ordering system
                        by a named person, that person warrants that the Order is, and it is acknowledged the Order is deemed in favour of Us to be:

                        <p class="text-left">We will only use your information if we have a lawful reason to do so such as when it&rsquo;s our legal duty or we have your consent and when it&rsquo;s in our legitimate interest to do so. These include:</p>
                        <p class="text-left"><strong>Administration -</strong> To help us properly manage the products and services we provide to you and to maintain and update our records. For example, we need to be able to verify your identity to detect, prevent and address
                            fraud. We also use your information for charging and billing and to identify breaches of our terms and conditions of service.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left"><strong>Network, security and fraud protection -</strong> As part of our network protection activities, we monitor Domain Name Servers (DNS) for known malicious domains which can, amongst other things, lead to the downloading of
                            malicious software on to devices. Where Telstra&rsquo;s DNS services are used to connect to these known malicious domains, we may identify impacted customers for the purposes of notifying them so they can take action to protect
                            themselves.

                        <p class="text-left"><strong>Communication -</strong> We need to be able to communicate with you in order to provide you with our products and services. We might do this on mediums such as email, SMS, social media, search engines and web pages you
                            may visit.</p>
                        <p class="text-left"><strong>Improvement &ndash;</strong> We are constantly working to not only maintain and improve our products, services and processes but to develop new ones. We use information we hold to help us do this in several ways. For example,
                            to monitor network use, quality and performance, and to operate, maintain, develop, test and upgrade our systems and infrastructure. We may also combine information from one service with information from one of our partners&rsquo;
                            services to improve our credit assessment and debt recovery processes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left"><strong>Development and analysis -</strong> It&rsquo;s important we understand your information and communication needs. One of the ways we do this is through using analysis and business intelligence techniques. This gives us high
                            level insights into things like usage patterns, network performance, demographic trends and other types of behavioural data. In many cases this information is aggregated and de-identified when analysed. We may share these anonymised
                            insights with select business and commercial partners. In some cases, we may create insights with your information on an identified basis but would only do so in compliance with privacy laws (such as, with your consent).</p>

                            directly to you. This also may include products, services and offers provided by our trusted partners. In some cases, this marketing activity can continue after you have stopped using our products or services, unless you opt-out.
